## 1. What's the goal?
A native app that does something cool

### a. Why rust?
https://bitcoindevkit.org/docs/

Great libs for everything you care about

### b. Why Tauri?

egui, iced

### c. What's our secret sauce?
https://github.com/HarborWallet/harbor

A nicely decoupled architecture for doing async stuff.
